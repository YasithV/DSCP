    "Imagine that a vendor needs to start a business: a restaurant/cafe in the city of Melbourne. The first problem would be the selection of a location to establish a physical facility. The place should be selected considering <em>minimizing the costs</em> and <em>maximizing the generation of income</em>. These depend on several other factors. The most important information to consider is the number of restaurants/cafes that are already available in the neighborhood. Other than this basic factor, information such as the population of the neighborhood, public places/tourist attractions in the neighborhood also plays a major role in the success of such an establishment.\n",

    "Though an entrepreneur can do a basic identification of an opportunity by simply looking at basic factors, to see the big picture including minor details, a thorough analysis is essential. A clear idea about the competitors and the target groups in a certain neighborhood can be generated using data scientific analysis: clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data science tools, a powerful insight can be generated and the generated insights can be presented in an easy to understand format, with the help of visualization tools. A system developed for this task can be altered according to the need of a client with minimal changes in the code which makes the system very useful to a client universally."
